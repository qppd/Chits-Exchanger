# Servo Dispenser Enhancement Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. PIN_CONFIGURATION.h
**Added 2 new servo channel definitions:**
- `SERVO_CHANNEL_4` (Channel 4) - Additional servo channel
- `SERVO_CHANNEL_5` (Channel 5) - Additional servo channel

**Current servo channel usage:**
- Channel 0: ₱5 chits dispenser
- Channel 1: ₱10 chits dispenser  
- Channel 2: ₱20 chits dispenser
- Channel 3: ₱50 chits dispenser
- **Channel 4: New additional servo (TEST)**
- **Channel 5: New additional servo (TEST)**

### 2. SERVO_DISPENSER.h
**Added function declaration:**
- `void testAdditionalServos()` - Test function for the new servo channels

### 3. SERVO_DISPENSER.cpp
**Updated initialization:**
- Modified `initSERVO()` to initialize channels 0-5 (previously 0-3)
- Updated serial output to reflect 6 channels

**Added test function:**
- `testAdditionalServos()` - Implements the test sequence:
  1. Servo Channel 4 rotates CCW (counter-clockwise) for 1.5 seconds
  2. 500ms delay between operations
  3. Servo Channel 5 rotates CW (clockwise) for 3 seconds

### 4. ChitExchanger.ino
**Added serial command interface:**
- Type `TEST` in the Serial Monitor to trigger the test sequence
- Instructions displayed during startup

**Updated loop() function:**
- Added serial command processing at the start of loop
- Monitors for "TEST" command to execute `testAdditionalServos()`

## How to Use

### Testing the New Servos:
1. Upload the updated code to your ESP32
2. Open Serial Monitor (9600 baud)
3. Type `TEST` and press Enter
4. Observe the servo test sequence:
   - Channel 4 will rotate CCW for 1.5 seconds
   - Brief pause
   - Channel 5 will rotate CW for 3 seconds
5. Check Serial Monitor for detailed logs

### Technical Details:
- **Servo Direction:**
  - CCW (Counter-Clockwise): Uses `SERVO_BACKWARD` (PWM value 300)
  - CW (Clockwise): Uses `SERVO_FORWARD` (PWM value 450)
  - Stop: Uses `SERVO_STOP` (PWM value 375) or `stopServo()` which sets PWM to 0

- **PCA9685 PWM Driver:**
  - Supports up to 16 channels (0-15)
  - Operating at 50Hz frequency for servo control
  - Currently using 6 channels (0-5)

### Future Expansion:
The PCA9685 has 10 more available channels (6-15) that can be used for additional servos or other PWM-controlled devices.

## Notes:
- The test function is non-blocking during execution but uses delays
- Servos are stopped by setting PWM to 0 for complete deactivation
- All servos are 360-degree continuous rotation servos
- Timing can be adjusted by modifying the delay values in the test function
